Should I buy the bag ?

That's the question my friend Pauline was repeatedly asking us about a Furla bag she had seen on Vinted. She really wanted it but couldn't get it to a good price.
I first draw her a diagram (find it here: http://bit.ly/2vCw5pZ) with good questions to find out if she really should buy the bag or not. Then I realised now that I can develop apps to make the process accessible to anyone facing this tragic shopping crisis.

There it is, Shopping Crisis, the app that helps you make a choice when life is too hard.

Pick the item of your choice, the one that gets you in such a trouble.
Complete the quizz.
You'll know then if you should buy that item or not.

You'll thank me later.
